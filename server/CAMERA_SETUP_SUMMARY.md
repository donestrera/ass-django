# Camera Setup and Image Capture Solution

This document summarizes the changes made to fix the camera image capture and display issues in the application.

## Issues Identified

1. **OpenCV Installation Issues**: The OpenCV library was installed in a Python 3.13 site-packages directory, but the virtual environment was using Python 3.9, causing import errors.

2. **Camera Permission Issues**: The terminal application didn't have permission to access the camera on macOS, resulting in "not authorized to capture video" errors.

3. **Path Issues**: The camera module was using relative paths instead of absolute paths, causing issues with finding and saving images to the correct location.

4. **Error Handling**: The camera module and API endpoints lacked comprehensive error handling and logging.

5. **Image Display Issues**: The client-side component needed improvements to handle different detection types and image loading failures.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Camera Module Improvements

- Updated `camera.py` to use absolute paths for saving images
- Added comprehensive logging to track the image capture process
- Improved error handling with detailed error messages and stack traces
- Added a fallback method for saving images when the primary method fails
- Added a `test_camera_access` function to verify camera accessibility

### 2. API Endpoint Improvements

- Updated the `person_detected` function to properly handle camera module imports and errors
- Enhanced the `handle_motion_event` method to use absolute paths and better error handling
- Improved the `captured_images` endpoint to handle different detection types and file errors
- Added verification of file readability and size before including in the response

### 3. Client-Side Improvements

- Updated the `CameraLogView` component to handle different detection types (YOLO, PIR, Test)
- Added fallback images for when image loading fails
- Improved error handling for image display
- Added helper functions for detection type labels, colors, and icons

### 4. Testing and Diagnostics

- Created a `simple_camera_test.py` script to check camera device accessibility without OpenCV
- Created a `setup_and_test_camera.py` script to install OpenCV and test camera functionality
- Created a `camera_permissions_guide.py` script to help users grant camera permissions
- Added comprehensive documentation in `CAMERA_SETUP.md` for troubleshooting

## How to Test the Camera Functionality

1. Ensure your terminal application has camera permissions:

   - Open System Preferences/Settings
   - Go to 'Security & Privacy' or 'Privacy & Security'
   - Select 'Camera' from the left sidebar
   - Make sure your terminal application is checked

2. Run the setup and test script:

   ```bash
   python3 setup_and_test_camera.py
   ```

3. Check the `media/captured_images` directory for the captured test image.

4. Start the Django server and test the API endpoints:

   ```bash
   python3 manage.py runserver
   ```

5. Access the web interface and check the "Captured Images" tab in the Camera Logs view.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. Check the `camera_test.log` and `camera.log` files for error messages
2. Verify that OpenCV is installed correctly: `pip show opencv-python`
3. Ensure the media directory exists and is writable
4. Check camera permissions in System Preferences/Settings

## Future Improvements

1. Add a camera settings page in the web interface
2. Implement image compression to reduce storage requirements
3. Add facial recognition capabilities
4. Implement video recording for motion events
5. Add email or push notifications for detection events
